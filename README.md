Simple website

Following The Odin Project curriculum in order for me to get better at navigating files and directories over the Terminal.

This entire project will serve to build up the muscle memory I need to navigate the Terminal and practice the most common commands.

There are only two simple rules:

 - I cannot open/create/delete anything using my mouse, everything must be handled via the terminal, this includes files, folders and programs.

 - My staged changes and commited files must be also updated from the Terimnal.

 * Using VSCode integrated terminal is fine, but I will try to stick to the Linux Terminal as much as I can.
